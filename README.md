    Improvements I made: I update the README.md to be a bit more descriptive. I also updated the closest_wendys.py lab to open a data file using 'with open' instead of just 'open'.
I recently learned that using 'with open' is better practice because it will ensure that you always close the file, even if an exception is raised inside the with block.
